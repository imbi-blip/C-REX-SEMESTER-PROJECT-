# C-REX-SEMESTER-PROJECT-
Using C language, I along with one of my classmates developed the google T-Rex game as our semester project with certain amendments i.e. the obstacles were changed to meteoroids and they practically fell out from the sky and slid on ground, the dinosaur was also equipped with a feature to shoot these meteoroids.
